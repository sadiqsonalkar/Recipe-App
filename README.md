# Recipe-App-Source
This is the Source Code for the recipe application i.e. S Foody

# Concept:
This application will serve as a platform that let us search the recipe we want to make. And we can add that recipe in our favorite section so you can see that recipe later.
The main objective of this application is the user can search recipe and save it into favorite section instead of going to search books for the recipe or the website. The user will find everything in my application.
The user can filter and search the recipe. Offline caching will help user to view the recipe already seen.
It will also display number of likes and if the recipe is vegan or cheap and many other details about the recipe.
Last there is a food joke section that will fetch new joke related to food, every time you visit the food joke section while you are online. You can share your food joke to others too.
