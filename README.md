# Recipe-App-Source
This is the Source Code for the recipe application i.e. S Foody

Aim: 
This application will serve as a platform that let us search the recipe we want to make. And we can add that recipe in our favourite section so you can see that recipe later.

Introduction: 
There are a number of applications in Android store for Recipes Search but none of them support interface for searching, saving them into favourites, and give detail of the recipe all at once.
S Foody is an Android application with image-based UI for searching, saving recipes and getting detail of the recipe.
This app provides flexibility to user to search variety in recipes from available recipes in the API.
In this Application I’m using Spoonacular API. This is one of the best API for searching recipe.
This app is time saver providing recipes in few clicks. By combining ingredients and title search, S Foody app makes finding recipes easy.
The project has been implemented using Kotlin, Android Studio and The Spoonacular API.

Modules:
01.	Recipe Fragment: In this fragment recipe will be shown fetched from the API.
02.	Search Recipe: We can also search the recipe we want and my application will fetch and show you your required recipe.
03.	Overview: In the overview section we will get the overview of the recipe it will show how much minute it will take to cook and how many likes does that recipe have.
04.	Ingredient Overview: Here we will get the overview and the detail of the ingredient required to cook that recipe.
05.	Instruction:  In this section we will get to know how to cook the recipe and everything.
06.	Bottom Sheet: We can filter the recipe according to meal type and diet type. E.g., if we want dessert and it should be vegan. We can do it here.
07.	Favourite Recipe: We can save our favourite recipe into favourite recipe section. And we can see that recipe whenever we want.
08.	Food Joke: Food joke section will fetch new joke related to food from the API every time you visit the Food Joke section.
09.	Offline Caching: I have put offline caching into my project. So, we can fetch the old recipe that is stored in our cache.
10.	Dark Mode: I have also put Dark mode in my application. So, if your mobile phone support dark mode you can use my application in dark mode.

Advantage:
•	User don’t have to go through books or website to find a recipe. He can use foody.
•	User can search any recipe. 
•	He can filter which meal and diet type should be included in the recipe.
•	Can save his/her favourite recipes into favourite section.
•	User will get to how much time a recipe will take to cook. 
•	And how many like that recipe has in the API.
•	It will give every minute detail of the recipe.
•	And the application will give every detail about every ingredient used in the recipe.
•	User can use my application in dark mode.
•	Offline Caching will help user to see the latest recipe he/she saw while he/she was online.

Objective:
The main objective of this application is the user can search recipe and save it into favourite section instead of going to search books for the recipe or the website. The user will find everything in my Application. 
The user can filter and search the recipe. Offline caching will help user to view the recipe already seen.
Concept:
01.	When the user First open my application a splash screen displaying my application name.
02.	Then a number of default recipes will be shown.

08.	There is an ingredient section that will give the details of the ingredient required for the recipe.
09.	Also, it will show the ingredient quantity required to cook the recipe and whether the ingredient is in solid or liquid form.
10.	In Instruction section it will take you to a website to show you how to cook the recipe in detail.
11.	You can add any recipe to your favourite section by clicking on the star.
12.	And in your favourite section, all the recipe will be displayed that you have selected as favourite.
13.	You can delete a single recipe from your favourite section or you can delete all at once.
14.	Last there is a food joke section that will fetch new joke related to food, every time you visit the food joke section while you are online.
